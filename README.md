# Wedding pictures Page

After completing a JHUB assesment in Web Design i moved on to dynamic web design using REACT. After various itterations of small tasks to understand the workings of react, i developed this website which was generated using uicoach.io. this enabled me to practice my component building and improve my CSS coding skills. 

## The uicoach brief

The brief was to create a website that a newly wed couple could view all their special day pictures, using a set colour pallet and font family.

### The Landing page

the lay out was used as it challenged my use of display flex, and utilizing ofsets.

### Bridesmaid and Groomsman

these pages have been compiled the same for uniformity as with the image shapes for all pages. on these pages the header has been used as the return button to to reduce clutter.

###Bride and Groom

by using larger images they become more focal and have the abilty to imput more images to scroll through or to keep it on one page a carousel can be added to each image container
