# Wedding pictures Page

After completing a JHUB assesment in Web Design i moved on to dynamic web design using REACT. After various itterations of small tasks to understand the workings of react, i developed this website which was generated using uicoach.io. this enabled me to practice my component building and improve my CSS coding skills. 

## The uicoach brief

The brief was to create a website that a newly wed couple could view all their special day pictures, using a set colour pallet and font family.

### The Landing page

the lay out was used as it challenged my use of display flex, and utilizing ofsets.
